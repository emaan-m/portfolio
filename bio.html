<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am a highschool junior from Boston living in California. I love reading, writing, baking and photography. I'm a femminist and an egalitarian.
You can see some of my pictures in the "photography" tab.</p>
<p>I love rainy days and cloudy weather. I like the beach and basically want a really aesthetic life but certainly don't have one. I also love cats and swimming.</p>
<p> Among the things that I despise are bugs and my friend's demonic goats. Hot weather is also the bane of my aesthetic existence. I also don't like small children and ignorance.
<p>Fun Fact! My dad used to be friends with Natalie Portman.
