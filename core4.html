<h1>The Core Four</h1>
<p>the Core Four are the logical problem solving concepts in computer science. They are as follows:</p>
<h2> Variables<h2>
<p> Variables are used to store different data types. An example in Python: forward(200)<p>

<p> An analogy for the real world is something like a computer chip. It is used to store information</p>
<h3>Conditionals</h3>
<p>Conditionals are defined as code that executes (a) statment(s) based on a boolean (true/false) condition. A Python example is if user_input== "yes"</p>

<p> A real world analogy is like an order. Like saying "If you walk the dog, then you can go to the park"</p>
<h4>Loops</h4>
<p> Loops are codes that repeat(s) (a) statement(s) while a given condition is true or false. For Python, you indent it</p>

<p>An analogy to the real world is like telling someone to keep running UNTIL they're out of breath.</p>
<h5>Functions<h5>
<p>Functions are blocks of code that are readable and usable by other coders. Functions use variables, conditions and loops. Functions in Python can be downloaded from places like the Turtle Library.</p>

<p>Coders use functions to share their work with each other and allow other people to improve upon it.</p>
